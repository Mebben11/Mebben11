- Hey! Im Michael
- I am a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point who is studying Computer Information Systems
- I'm ambitious in learning more about software development, and hope to create more projects in the near future

- Current Project: Once this NBA season is over (4/14) I am going to compile all of the individual player data and make a SQL Database for it
- I will likely also make Queries to analyze the tables I have created 🏀
- There is potential that I complete the project by using the database as a backend, and develop a front end website (or just .html, .js, and .css (potentially JSON) files) to develop a cleaner UI for comparing Player Statistics.
