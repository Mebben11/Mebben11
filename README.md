- Hey! Im Michael
- I am a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point who is studying Computer Information Systems
- I'm ambitious in learning more about software development, and hope to create more projects in the near future

- Current Project: Once this NBA season is over (4/14) I am going to compile all of the individual player data and make a SQL Database for the team statistics, and individual player statistics as well. As of 7/20 (The day I am updating this) after a couple month's delay I have completed the data compilation, and have a rough web page created in order to display this data in the form of a HTML data table to the user. This table is sortable, and also allows the user to search for a specific player. I will release it publicly soon just to have it open as part of project list.
- Project Knowledge:
HTML Data Tables,
Data Compiling,
JavaScript DOM manipulation,
CSS Styling,
JQuery & 3rd Party Utilization,
Basic SQL Table creation and Queries,
Excel and Google Sheet Spreadsheet creation/manipulation.
- Overall:
    This was a passion project that I figured would be a good introduction in the usefulness of Web Development for a hobbyist. As I continue my Academic career at UWSP, I look forward to more of these types of projects in order to not only build up my resume, but also make use of skills that are actively being built and refined.

- Next Project: "Daily Tracker", The next project will be my first attempt at building a desktop application that allows the user to input information about their daily life, which the app will keep track of and provide a data summary for the user. Things such as Tracking Fitness goals, finances/budget, hobbies, To-Do lists, calender dates etc. This will just be an application for everyday use, and help the user manage their daily tasks and aid in visualising their habits.

- Completed Projects:
